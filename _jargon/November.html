    <h5 class="card-title">Boil the Ocean</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      <p>In this article John Thomas distinguished engineer and director at IBM states how he would not take all of the
        AI tools and run them against his data banks; but rather run one at a time until his needs are fit. He states
        this by using the phrase “boil the ocean” to summarize how this all-or-nothing approach will turn out, “In my
        experience, this ‘Oh, I’m going to transform my business in one big boil-the-ocean exercise’ does not work.” I
        have never heard of this particular jargon before, despite it being quite popular and hated. I can see why as I
        had no idea what he was talking about reading out of context.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Barking Up the Wrong Tree</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      <p>In this article a reader writes to a Forbes contributor with an experience they had reading one candidate's
        LinkedIn profile. The profile summary contained comments stating that his previous employer was run by
        semi-criminals , is being sued by its investors, everyone there was a scammer, and a lot more. The
        contributor's, Liz, reply started with the jargon, “barking up the wrong tree.” Also stating that such
        complaints belong on Glassdoor and not his LinkedIn profile.</p>
